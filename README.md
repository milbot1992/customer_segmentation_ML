# Customer Segmentation Analysis - Machine Learning

Customer Segmentation Analysis is a comprehensive examination of a company's distinct customer groups. This analysis empowers businesses to gain a deep understanding of their customers, facilitating the customisation of products to align with the unique needs, behaviours, and concerns of different customer segments.

By conducting a Customer Segmentation Algorithm, businesses can refine their products based on the preferences and characteristics of specific customer segments. Instead of investing resources in marketing a new product to the entire customer database, a company can identify the most receptive segment and tailor its marketing efforts exclusively to that particular group. This strategic approach ensures a more targeted and efficient use of resources in reaching the most responsive audience.
